Job Sequencing Problem
Given a list of tasks with deadlines and total profit earned on completing a task, find the maximum profit earned by executing the tasks within the specified deadlines. Assume that each task takes one unit of time to complete, and a task canâ€™t execute beyond its deadline. Also, only a single task will be executed at a time.

Weighted Interval Scheduling Problem
Given a list of jobs where each job has a start and finish time, and has profit associated with it, find a maximum profit subset of non-overlapping jobs.
