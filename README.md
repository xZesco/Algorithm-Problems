# Algorithm-Problems

## Introduction

Welcome to the Algorithm-Problems repository! This repository contains solutions to two classic algorithmic problems:

1. Job Sequencing Problem
2. Weighted Interval Scheduling Problem

These problems are fundamental in the field of algorithms and have practical applications in various domains such as scheduling, resource allocation, and optimization.

## Problem Descriptions

### Job Sequencing Problem:

The Job Sequencing Problem involves scheduling tasks with deadlines and associated profits to maximize total profit while adhering to task deadlines. Each task requires one unit of time to complete and must be executed within its deadline. The goal is to find the maximum profit achievable by executing tasks within their deadlines.

### Weighted Interval Scheduling Problem:

The Weighted Interval Scheduling Problem deals with scheduling jobs with start and finish times and associated profits. The objective is to select a subset of non-overlapping jobs that maximizes total profit. Each job has a start time, a finish time, and a profit associated with it. The challenge is to find the subset of jobs that maximizes profit without overlapping in their time intervals.

## Repository Structure


The repository is structured into separate directories for each problem. Each directory contains a `README.md` file describing the problem, a solution file (`solution.py`), and potentially other relevant files.

## Usage

Each problem directory contains a solution file (`solution.py`) with the implementation of the algorithm to solve the respective problem. You can use these solutions as a reference or integrate them into your projects.

## Contributions

Contributions to this repository are welcome! If you have an improvement or a new solution to any of the problems, feel free to open a pull request. Please ensure that your code is well-documented and follows the repository's coding standards.
